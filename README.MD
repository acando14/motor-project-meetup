# Symfony 5 project - intro meetup -

## Controller
Install maker bundle, it isn't part of skeleton project :

```bash
composer require symfony/maker-bundle --dev
```

Use it to create a controller, it is so easy (and interactive) :

```bash
php bin/console make:controller  
```


We will use @annotation for make a controller securized but
you can make the same with a .yaml file (recommended) :

```bash
composer require annotations
```
